/*
 * Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days.
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 * Given an array `weights` representing package weights and an integer `D` (days),
 * find the minimum ship capacity required to deliver all packages within `D` days.
 * The ship must take packages in the given order and can only ship once per day.
 *
 * Approaches:
 *
 * 1. Linear Search (Brute Force) – O(N * Sum(weights))
 *    - Compute `maxWeight` (heaviest package) and `sumWeight` (total weight).
 *    - Try all capacities from `maxWeight` to `sumWeight`.
 *    - Use a helper function `canShip(weights, cap, D)` to check feasibility.
 *    - Inefficient for large weight arrays.
 *
 * 2. Binary Search (Optimal) – O(N log Sum(weights))
 *    - Perform binary search in the range `[maxWeight, sumWeight]`.
 *    - Compute `mid` and check if it's a valid ship capacity.
 *    - If `mid` can ship in `D` days, reduce capacity (`right = mid`).
 *    - Otherwise, increase capacity (`left = mid + 1`).
 *
 * Complexity Analysis:
 *
 * | Approach                   | Time Complexity       | Space Complexity |
 * |----------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
 * | Linear Search (Brute)      | O(N * Sum(weights)) | O(1)          |
 * | Binary Search (Optimal)    | O(N log Sum(weights)) | O(1)          |
 *
 * Conclusion:
 * - **Binary Search** efficiently finds the minimum ship capacity.
 * - **Much faster than brute force, especially for large input sizes.**
