/*
 Problem Statement:
Given a rotated sorted array of integers, `arr`, and a target integer, `target`, the task is to find the index of the target in the array. If the target is not found, return `-1`. The array is sorted, but then rotated at an unknown pivot, and each element in the array is unique.

 Approach:
1. Binary Search: Since the array is sorted but rotated, we can use a modified binary search.
2. Identifying the Pivot: The array can be divided into two partsâ€”one part is sorted in ascending order, and the other part is rotated.
3. Two Cases in Each Iteration:
   - Left side is sorted: If the element at the left pointer (`arr[left]`) is less than or equal to the element at the middle (`arr[mid]`), the left side is sorted. In this case, check if the target lies between `arr[left]` and `arr[mid]`. If yes, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`; otherwise, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - Right side is sorted: If the left side is not sorted, then the right side must be sorted. In this case, check if the target lies between `arr[mid]` and `arr[right]`. If yes, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`; otherwise, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.


 Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: The algorithm runs in O(log N) time because it uses binary search, reducing the problem size by half in each iteration.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) because the solution uses a constant amount of extra space for the variables (`left`, `right`, and `mid`).

 Key Observations:
- We exploit the fact that the array is sorted (before being rotated), which allows us to efficiently narrow down the search space by checking which half is sorted at each step.
- The algorithm works even for edge cases like when the array is not rotated or the target is not in the array.
