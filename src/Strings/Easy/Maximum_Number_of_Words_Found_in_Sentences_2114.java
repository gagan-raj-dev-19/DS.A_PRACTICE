/*
**Problem Statement**
You are given an array of strings, where each string represents a sentence. The task is to find the maximum number of words present in a single sentence. Words in a sentence are separated by spaces.

---

 **Approach**
1. **Thought Process**:
   - Iterate through each sentence in the array.
   - For each sentence, count the number of spaces (`' '`) and add one to get the word count since words are separated by spaces.
   - Track the maximum word count encountered across all sentences.

2. **Possible Optimizations**:
   - Instead of counting spaces manually, leverage built-in methods like `split(" ")` to calculate the word count more concisely. However, using `split()` may introduce slight overhead due to array creation.
   - Focus on edge cases, such as:
     - Empty strings.
     - Sentences with trailing, leading, or multiple consecutive spaces.



 Complexity Analysis
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Let `n` be the total number of sentences and `m` be the average length of each sentence.
   - For each sentence, we iterate through all characters, leading to a complexity of \( O(n \times m) \).
2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The solution uses \( O(1) \) extra space since no additional data structures are used apart from variables.



 **Optimized Approach (Optional)**
Using the `split(" ")` method:

java
class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        int maxCount = 0;
        for (String sentence : sentences) {
            int wordCount = sentence.split(" ").length; // Count words using split
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, wordCount); // Update maxCount
        }
        return maxCount;
    }
}


Complexity
- **Time**: Still \( O(n \times m) \), but with extra overhead for splitting.
- **Space**: \( O(m) \), for the temporary array created by `split`.
