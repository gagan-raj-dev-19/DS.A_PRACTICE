simply we can return
num1+num2 so avoids redundancy!

Problem Statement
Write a function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum. This is a basic problem that tests understanding of function implementation, parameter passing, and return values in Java.

---

 Approach
1. **Thought Process**:
   - Simply add the two integers using the `+` operator and return the result.
   - This is a straightforward implementation as there are no edge cases to handle for basic integer addition in Java.

2. **Optimizations**:
   - The problem does not have scope for optimization as it deals with a single operation (addition) which is already O(1).

Complexity Analysis
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - **O(1)**: Addition of two integers is a constant-time operation.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - **O(1)**: The method uses a single integer variable `sum` to store the result, which does not depend on the input size.
